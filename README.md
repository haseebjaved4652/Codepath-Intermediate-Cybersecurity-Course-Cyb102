## 🔍 Project Highlights by Unit

- **Unit 1** – Investigated real-world data breaches to understand the lifecycle of cyberattacks and response strategies.
- **Unit 2** – Analyzed system logs to detect attacker behaviors like lateral movement and privilege escalation.
- **Unit 3** – Explored MITRE ATT&CK tactics and how red teams emulate real-world adversaries.
- **Unit 4** – Reconstructed timelines from raw logs to build threat profiles and write professional-grade IR reports.
- **Unit 5** – Leveraged MISP to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) and researched threat actor campaigns.
- **Unit 6** – Profiled modern ransomware groups and mapped their tactics to industry-recognized frameworks.
- **Unit 7** – Built Splunk dashboards to detect TOR traffic using threat feeds and log correlation.
- **Unit 8** – Collaborated on a capstone team project using open datasets and custom IR playbooks for end-to-end threat hunting.
- **Units 9–10** – Delivered final SOC reports and analysis during Demo Day, simulating a real-world security investigation.
