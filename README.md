## 🛡️ Intermediate Cybersecurity – CodePath (2025)

A 10-week hands-on course simulating real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows.  
Explored incident response, log analysis, threat intelligence, and SIEM tools through interactive labs, tools, and a capstone investigation.

### 🔍 Project Highlights by Unit

- **Unit 1:** Investigated major real-world data breaches to understand attacker behavior and response strategy.
- **Unit 2:** Analyzed system logs to uncover techniques like privilege escalation and lateral movement.
- **Unit 3:** Explored adversary emulation and MITRE ATT&CK tactics through simulated red team scenarios.
- **Unit 4:** Conducted timeline reconstruction and drafted professional-grade incident response reports.
- **Unit 5:** Used MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) to identify IOCs and research threat actor profiles.
- **Unit 6:** Researched recent ransomware campaigns and mapped their tactics to industry frameworks.
- **Unit 7:** Built dashboards in Splunk to detect TOR network traffic using real-time threat intelligence.
- **Unit 8:** Collaborated on a capstone team project using open-source datasets and IR playbooks to simulate end-to-end incident response.
- **Units 9–10:** Presented findings on Demo Day, showcasing SOC investigation, analysis, and reporting.
